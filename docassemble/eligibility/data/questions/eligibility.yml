  The Eligility Engine interview must be started with the URL argument:
  `eligibility_id`
  Otherwise, it will automatically return a qualification code of -1
  indicating "Your qualification can not be determined."
  
  There are also two optional (but highly recomended) URL arguments:
  `org_slug`
  `service_slug`
  These are the slugs for the Organization providing the service
  and the Service itself on Instant Attorney.
 
  For more details on URL arguments in docassemble, please see the documentation:
  https://docassemble.org/docs/special.html#url_args

  Get the Service information from Instant Attorney
  using the `org_slug` and `service_slug` from the URL arguments.

  Get the Eligibility code from Instant Attorney
  using the `eligibility_id` from the URL arguments.
---
code: |
  import sys
  import io

  # create file-like string to capture output
  qualifyOut = io.StringIO()
  qualifyError = io.StringIO()

  # capture output and errors
  sys.stdout = qualifyOut
  sys.stderr = qualifyError

  exec (eligibility_code)

  # restore stdout and stderr
  sys.stdout = sys.__stdout__
  sys.stderr = sys.__stderr__

  qualify = qualify()

  info = qualifyOut.getvalue()
  if qualifyError.getvalue():
    log("error:\n%s\n" % qualifyError.getvalue(), "danger")

  Run the Eligibility code fetched from Instant Attorney.
  
  The default Eligibility code looks like this:
  # Eligibility Engine
  def qualify():
    return 1
  
  There may be more than one fuction, but there must be
  a `qualify()` function defined and this will acts as
  the "main" for your Eligibility code.

  The expected return value is an integer.
  If your code is able to make a determination of eligibility,
  it should return a value between 0 and 1 both inclusive using fuzzy logic:
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic

  For whatever reason the function can not make a determination,
  it should return -1. All other retrun values will be treated as a -1.

  - Back to Listing:

        apply = False
comment: |
  This is functionally the exit block for this interview.
  If the user selects "Apply Now", then the interview will
  attempt to redirect the user to the URL for the Resource
  from Instant Attorney.

  Or if the user chooses "Back to Listing", the interview will
  attempt to redirect the user to the Resource listing
  on Instant Attorney.
