  Welcome to the Instant Attorney!

  Instant Attorney will ask you a few questions and then direct
  you to the appropriate legal resource listed on [Clerical Hub],

comment: |
  This allows the user to choose the category for their issue.
  These categories are from the draft National Subject Matter Index (NSMI) v2.0.
  As more categories and sub-categories are added, more triage can take place.

question: |
  Issue Location
subquestion: |
 Please select the state where the issue occured.
 Also, indicate whether this is different from
 where you live now.
fields:
  - Issue is in: client.issue.address.state
    input type: combobox
    code: |
      states_list()
  - This is also where I live now: issue_residence_same
    datatype: yesno
    default: True
  - I live in: client.address.state
    input type: combobox
    code: |
      states_list()
    show if:
      variable: issue_residence_same
      is: False
comment: |
  This allows a user to select their state.
  Eventually, the goal is to have this be international and not just for the US.
  Additionally, more narrow geolation will be desired such as the particular county.
  The user's state of residence, if different than the issue is currently unused.

  In this code block, the Instant Attorney table from Clerical Hub is retrieved
  for all Instant Attorneys that fit the user's issue.
  The results are then narrowed down by the state.
  There is a bit of checking to make sure that the API behaved as expected.
  The matching records are then added the apps.matches DAList
